# PSA Firmware Update Specification

This repository serves as public collaboration point for evolution of the [PSA Firmware Update Specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0093/0000/?lang=en)

Firmware update support is an essential property of any IoT device. However, the mechanism to update firmware on a device differs significantly across embedded platforms. The PSA Firmware Update Specification is designed to describes a standard interface for updating firmware. By providing a consistent interface for firmware update, update clients and cloud connectors can be written in a more platform independent manner.
